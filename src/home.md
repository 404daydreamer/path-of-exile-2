### Overview

The sequel introduces a fresh **six-act campaign**, a revamped skill gem system, and enhanced character customization with a redesigned passive skill tree, including dual specialization.
### Story and Campaign
In **Path of Exile 2**, players will face an ancient evil threatening Wraeclast. The campaign includes **seven acts**, featuring new areas, towns, and characters, alongside some returning favorites. The world is darker and deadlier, with tougher quests and dynamic world events.

## Gameplay Features

- **Visceral Combat**: Path of Exile 2 emphasizes smooth melee combat, allowing for retargeting during ability animations. This enhances movement freedom and enables players to correct misses during combat.

- **Ability Cost Mechanics**: The resource cost of using abilities is now spread across the full animation time, reducing penalties for canceling abilities mid-animation. This change enhances combat fluidity and allows for more strategic gameplay.

- **Dodge Rolling Mechanic**: All characters have access to a dodge roll that cancels current actions and animations. It allows players to avoid projectiles and strikes but does not increase movement speed. Dodge rolling is crucial for evasion during boss fights.

- **Accuracy Rating**: Accuracy rating determines the hit chance of an attack, which is influenced by character gear and the passive skill tree. Monsters' evasion is based on their level and modifiers, and specific mechanics can bypass accuracy requirements.

- **Spirit Resource**: A new resource called Spirit is introduced, which is used for reservation skills and maintaining permanent minions. Spirit comes primarily from equipment modifiers and the passive skill tree.

- **Leech Mechanic**: The leech system has been simplified, with two main modifiers: damage dealt percentage and leech resistance on monsters. This balances character damage growth against monster resistance.

- **Energy Shield Recovery**: Energy shield recovers at a rate of 33.3% per second after four seconds without taking damage. Poison and bleeding damage bypass energy shield, hitting life directly.

## In-Game Features

- **Skill Gem System Overhaul**: The skill gem system has been completely reworked. Skill gems are now linked directly to characters rather than gear, allowing support gems to be attached directly to skill gems, which simplifies build diversity.

- **New Weapon Types**: Path of Exile 2 introduces new weapon types such as spears, crossbows, and a hybrid ranged/melee spear, enhancing build customization options.

- **Unique Boss Encounters**: The game features over 100 unique bosses, each with specialized maps and revamped fight mechanics that require critical thinking and skillful movement from players.

- **Cross-Play and Cross-Progression**: The game supports local couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression across different platforms, allowing players to use the same character on various consoles or PCs.

- **Dynamic Environment Interactions**: Players must navigate skillfully through boss stages using the new dodge mechanic while avoiding attacks, favoring precise movements over simple gear checks.

- **Enhanced Visuals and Animations**: Combat animations have been improved to create a more fluid and responsive feel, making each weapon feel distinct in terms of functionality during battles.
